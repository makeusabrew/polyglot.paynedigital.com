# PD Polyglot

An academic exercise to try and mimic the existing
[paynedigital.com](http://paynedigital.com) website in a variety of languages
using some technologies Iâ€™m interested in. Language wise, the shortlist at
the moment looks like:

* Go
* Scala
* Ruby
* PHP (just a clone of [the original repo](https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com))
* NodeJS

Technology wise, the things of interest (to me) are:

* Vagrant
* Docker (possibly; if so instead of Vagrant)
* Puppet
* Nginx

## Implementation status

So far only one: just the original PHP website. Go port underway.
